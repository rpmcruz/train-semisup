# train-semisup
Trains model using my "semisup" repository.

We added the [semisup library](https://github.com/rpmcruz/semisup) as a submodule:
    git submodule add https://github.com/rpmcruz/semisup

If you make any modification to `semisup`, after commit (inside that directory), do a push using:
    git push origin main
